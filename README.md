# Calculating the median and percentiles

You will have seen that all the bubbles have different sizes when you plotted the data. We thus need to do something to make the data from the experiment comprehensible when we include the results from our experiments in the article that we publish on the paper.  You have learned various operations that we can do to simplify a data set such as this one to a more compact form that is suitable for publication.  Over the next few tasks, we are thus going to revise the concepts you learned then.   

__With that in mind, I would like you to complete the code on the right which outputs information on the range, median and interquartile range for this data set that I have loaded from the file called `bubbles.dat`.__

To complete this exercise you need to calculate:

1. the minimum of the data set
2. the lower quartile
3. the median
4. the upper quartile
5. the maximum

for the data that has been read in from `bubbles.dat`. These quantities should be saved in variables called `dmin`, `lowq`, `median`, `highq` and `dmax`.
